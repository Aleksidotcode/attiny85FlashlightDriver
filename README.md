# attiny85FlashlightDriver
Driver for driving CREE XHP 70 led from single 3.7V battery


This is my first bigger project, and first for doing any sort of PCB for it, so help is needed...
I'm trying to update everything to this page, feel free to copy this design, everything in here is open source
I will not be responsible for any sort of damage done to components (mainly the code) so double check everything if you are trying to build something based on this...
